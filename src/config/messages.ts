Airdrops are a way to validate a user's proof of history in a protocol. While there are no guarantees, the formula is usually a high number of interactions, volume and TVL with the protocols contracts.

     ‚ùñ None of your actions will be in vain, as the stronger your transaction history, the better is the proof of history of your wallet. This is a marathon, not a sprint! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

     ‚ùñ Farmville automates the manual effort associated with consistently interacting with a large number of protocol ecosystems. 

     ‚ùñ Here is a list of ecosystems that we are live with now, with new ones being added every 2 weeks.
